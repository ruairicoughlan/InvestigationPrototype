  successDescription: "The skylight above could have been an entrance, I suppose.
    Although, now that I\u2019m looking at it, there\u2019s no signs of the locks
    or hatches being manipulated. \n\nIf the thief entered, they didn\u2019t break
    in from the roof. They came in on ground level. And Serena already said none
    of the other doors look like there was a forced entry. They either picked the
    locks or had the doors opened...."
